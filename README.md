# Intrusion detection system (IDS) using Binary Ensemble of Deep-Learning Classifiers

We built a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) and Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) using deep learning frameworks and models. For NIDS we using binary ensemble classifiers and them used ensemble learning to compile it. For HIDS we pre-processed the data using pandas and then used deep learning models to compile it. It produced better results than other methods. Got to use libraries like tensorflow, keras, pandas in python.

We achieved a training accuracy of 99.86% and testing accuracy of 81% on the deep learning model. We also used precision and recall, f1 score as a metrics other than accuracy and got an average score of 0.99.
